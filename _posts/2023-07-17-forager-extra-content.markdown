### How I Made Forager - 我做浮岛物语的历程

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/1.jpeg)
As a  kid, I had a lot of trouble at school.<br/>
I kept skipping classes to make toys and games.<br/>
This had my dad very very worried about my future.<br/>
我小的时候，是个问题学生，经常性地逃课去做一些玩具和游戏，这让我爸对我的未来发愁。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/2.jpeg)
A few years later, he got very sick and soon passed away.<br/>
Before he did, he made sure to tell me he wasn't disappointed and that I could achieve my dreams if i learned to focus and work in a team.<br/>
几年后，我爸得了场大病去世了。在他离开之前，真诚地对我说，他并不对我感到失望，反而他觉得如果我学着去专注、去融入到团队中努力工作，那我将成就我自己的梦想。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/3.jpeg)
I dropped out of school to chase my dream of making videogames.<br/>
My family and friends were worried and thought it was a terrible idea!<br/>
我退学了，去追求我的梦想，去开发电子游戏。我的朋友和亲人都很担心我，觉得这不是一个很的主意。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/4.jpeg)
I worked very hard for a year.<br/>
Learned as much as I could and did my absolute best.<br/>
接下来的一年里，我非常努力，尽我所能地持续学习。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/5.jpeg)
But nobody was interested in the stuff I was making...<br/>
但没有人对我做出来的东西感兴趣。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/6.jpeg)
Eventually I ran out of money. I had to move back home.<br/>
My mom welcomed me with open arms and invested her live savings in my dream, barely knowing what a video game even was.<br/>
最终，我的钱花完了，我不得不返回家里。没想到我妈不但欢迎我回家，甚至在对电子游戏知之甚少的情况下，把她节省下来积蓄资助我来完成梦想。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/7.jpeg)
After another couple of years, pressure and anxiety piled on me.<br/>
I started to feel like a failure.<br/>
Could I even do this? Had I made the wrong choice?<br/>
又过了一些年，压力和焦虑不断侵蚀着我，我开始有了些挫败感。我产生了怀疑：我能做到吗？我的选择是正确的吗？<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/8.jpeg)
I participated in a game jam, and made the first version of Forager in two weeks.<br/>
Unfortunately, I was running out of money again...<br/>
我参加了一场游戏制作马拉松（限时制作出一款游戏），在这两周内，浮岛物语的第一个版本完成了。坏消息是，我又花完了积蓄。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/9.jpeg)
I decided I would participate in one last competition before giving up.<br/>
I somehow managed to win a prize at this small event!<br/>
The prize was a trip to the USA to showcase Forager!<br/>
我打算在彻底放弃之前参加最后一次比赛。然而我竟然在这个小型赛事中得奖了！奖品是让我去美国展示浮岛物语这个游戏！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/10.jpeg)
I had all sorts of troubles along the way...<br/>
Including my only laptop blowing up before the showcase!<br/>
But I met lots of great people who helped me out.<br/>
这一路上我经历了许许多多的麻烦... 包括在展示游戏的前夕，我的笔记本电脑罢工了！但我也遇见了很多帮助我脱离困境的人。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/11.jpeg)
A new friend I met at a conference was late to his meeting because he was having to much fun playing Forager.<br/>
The person he was meeting with had to come and find him!<br/>
我的一个在展示大会上结识的朋友，他因为玩浮岛物语忘记了时间，错过了与某人的见面，而要见的那个人直接来找他了！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/12.jpeg)
He apologized and instead of pitching his own projects, started telling this person all blout Forager and how much fun he wa having.<br/>
He knew I had social anxiety and pitching the game in English was very hard for me.<br/>
他一边道歉一边向他的友人介绍浮岛物语以及这款游戏是多么的好玩，而他原先自己准备的项目却只字未提。他知道我有社交恐惧症，用英语来推销自己的游戏对我来说太难了。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/13.jpeg)
Turned out that this person worked for Humble Bundle!<br/>
He liked the game, and offered Forager a publishing deal!<br/>
后来才知道他在Humble Bundle（浮岛物语的发行商）工作！他超级喜欢这个游戏，并给提供了一份浮岛物语的发行协议！ <br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/14.jpeg)
I started to realize... I AM Forager!<br/>
Working hard all alone to build something amazing, something fun.<br/>
To build the future I wanted for myself.<br/>
我开始意识到，我自己就是一个搜寻者（浮岛物语英文名的原意）！独自努力创造令人惊奇、有趣的东西。创造我自己想要的未来。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/15.jpeg)
Forager started growing and people started to volunteer to help me with the game's development.<br/>
I wasn't alone anymore!<br/>
随着越来越多的志愿者参与到浮岛物语的开发，游戏也变得完善。我不再是一个人！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/16.jpeg)
Together, we built up Forager with years of work.<br/>
经过几年的努力 ，我们一同完成了浮岛物语这款游戏。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/17.jpeg)
I came to understand, we are ALL Foragers!<br/>
We start from the bottom and work hard to craft and build the things we feel passionate about.<br/>
我开始明白，我们都是搜寻者（浮岛物语英文名的原意）！我们从底层开始，努力打造我们所热爱的东西。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/18.jpeg)
Forager developed a very friendly and inclusive community!<br/>
Thousands of people started to add their own ideas and support to the project.<br/>
浮岛物语建立了一个非常友好和包容的社区！成百上千的人们开始往游戏中添加自己的想法，并持续支持这个项目。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/19.jpeg)
After a long wait, Forager was released!<br/>
The game even launched on several platforms!<br/>
经过一段长时间的等待，浮岛物语发布了！这个游戏终于在多个平台上架了！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/HowIMadeForage/20.jpeg)
I offered to pay my mom 3 times her original investment.<br/>
She said she just wanted me to invite her to dinner... and that dad would be very proud.<br/>
我想要支付给我妈他之前所出的三倍的资金做为回报。但她说她只是想让我邀请他共进晚餐... 爸爸一定也为你而骄傲。<br/>

### Concept Art -- 概念创作图<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/1.jpeg)
Originally, Forager was going to be a giant open world kinda game.<br/>
在最开始的时候，浮岛物语要做成一个大型的开放世界游戏。<br/>
This is the very first tileset concept Gaz came out with back then.<br/>
There were going to be secrets hidden all over the place.<br/>
这是 Gaz 当时提出的第一个瓦片集（Tileset，游戏制作用语）概念图。<br/>
这里面到处都隐藏着秘密。<br/>
Eventually I came up with the idea of buying islands to expand territory, and that was just so much more fun!<br/>
最终我想到了购买岛屿来扩大领土的想法，这个玩法将带来更多的乐趣！<br/>
In the end I am glad I made that choice, especially since BoTW came out shortly after and basically did the whole open world thing much better than whatever Gaz and I could have done!<br/>
很高兴我们最终选择了购买岛屿的想法，特别是旷野之息不久后就发布了，并且基本上在整个开放世界方面做得比我和 Gaz 能做的要好得多！<br/>
Broken bridge leading to another biome<br/>
去往其它群落的受损的桥<br/>
zelda-like grass fields<br/>
塞尔达式的草地<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/2.jpeg)
Gaz drew this amazing comcept art piece for the inital grassland area.<br/>
Gaz为初始的草原地区画了这张令人惊叹的概念图<br/>
That evil looking tower on the right was supposed to be a puzzle in which you had to figure out how to destroy it before a death laser was fired at you from the top for an insta-kill.<br/>
在图片右边看起来邪恶的塔是一个谜题，你必须在被来自塔顶的死亡激光秒杀前找到摧毁它的方法。<br/>
I eventually scrapped the design but used this idea for the Watchers in the Desert biome and in the Ancient Tomb.<br/>
我最终放弃了这个设计，而是将这个想法放在了沙漠群系中上古墓地的守护者身上。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/3.jpeg)
This is an early concept for the Desert biomed.<br/>
You can even see the Ancient Tomb dungeon on this one!<br/>
这是沙漠群系早期的概念设计图<br/>
你甚至已经可以看到上古墓地这个地牢已经出现在图中！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/4.jpeg)
This is one of my favorite pieces of concept art!<br/>
这是我最喜欢的概念创作图！<br/>
Gaz made this so we could start exploring Graveyard biome ideas after I played Minish Cap for way too long one night.<br/>
某天晚上我玩了很久的缩小帽，之后Gaz创作了这张图，我们又开始探讨墓地群系的想法。<br/>
Ghosts were supposed to be the main enemy of this area, but when Gaz drew the first ever Ghost in sprite art it looked so cute that I just NEEDED to have him as a little friendly NPC.<br/>
幽灵被设计为这个区域的主要敌人，但当Gaz将幽灵的sprite设计(游戏术语，类似于人物/物品图)创作出来时，他看起来如此可爱，我想我必须将他做为友好NPC中的一员。<br/>
I thought it would be funny for the little guy to try to get your help to get a bit... scarier. Too cute!<br/>
我想如果将这个小幽灵设计成需要玩家帮助他变得有一些可怕这将会很好玩。想想简直太可爱了！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/5.jpeg)
Stardew made me love the idea of a museum that could be filled with rare artifacts.<br/>
星露谷物语让我觉得在博物馆里收集一些罕见的物品这一主意很不错。<br/>
I told Gaz we should do something like that,and he almost immediately came up with a bunch of super cool designs for it!<br/>
我告诉Gaz，我们也需要这样的东西，他几乎马上就为此想出了一系列超级酷的设计！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/6.jpeg)
Ah yes, the Flower Press. <br/>
是的，这是花瓣压缩机。<br/>
After the closed beta was playable for a while, we realized we had a realy bad Iron Ore shortage problem. Iron deposites would just randomly stop spawning and players would run out of it quickly.<br/>
当测试版本玩了一阵子之后，我们意识到铁矿石短缺非常严重。铁矿石的生成会随机停止，玩家就会很快用完。<br/>
The game needed an industrial structure that would turn flowers and herb surplus into basic minerals.<br/>
游戏需要一个能将剩余的花和草转化成矿物质的工业装置。<br/>
I asked Gaz to come up with a weird building that would allow players to "recycle" flowers into iron ore, and the crazy genius came up with this "Flower Press", that would crush flowers into iron ore.<br/>
我找Gaz创造一个能让玩家将花回收成铁矿的奇怪装置，这个疯狂的天才想出了这个花瓣压缩机，能将花转化为铁矿。<br/>
I am not a scientist but that sounded about right.<br/>
我不是一个科学家，但这听起来蛮正确的。<br/>
 Eventually the Iron shortage bug was fixed, but the Flower Press was here to stay.<br/>
最终铁矿短缺的问题被修复了，但花瓣压缩机也被保留了下来。<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/7.jpeg)
These are very early concepts for what would become the angry Boar enemy.<br/>
And also, everyone's favorite poop collecting Fox!<br/>
这些是叫做愤怒野猪的敌人的早期概念设计，还有每个人都喜欢的便便收集者狐狸！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/8.jpeg)
These are the first concepts for the Ancient Tomb boss, which has always been my favorite boss in Forager!<br/>
这是上古墓地Boss的第一版概念设计图，这个Boss一直是我在浮岛物语中最喜欢Boss。<br/>
The Ancient Tomb was actually the first ever dungeon I designed, and you can tell this by the several mistakes and inconsistencies you can find.<br/>
上古墓地实际上是我设计的第一个地牢谜题，你可以发现这个迷宫有一些错误以及与其它谜题不一样。<br/>
I bet you get stuck here AT LEAST once!<br/>
我敢打赌你至少被困在这里一次！<br/>
Despite it's faults, it still holds a special place in my heart as my first ever attempt at a zelda-esque dungeon!<br/>
虽然他有一些错误，但他仍然处于我心中的重要地位，因为这是我第一次尝试塞尔达风格的地牢！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/9.jpeg)
These are the first 2 pieces of concept art Jon Nielsen sent me.<br/>
这是Jon Nielsen发给我的头两张概念设计图。<br/>
I found out about Jon by randomly browsing Twitter, he had made flinthook fanart that blew me away! the colors. I loved it !<br/>
我是在浏览Twitter时注意到的Jon，他创作的Flinthook同人作品给我留下了深刻的印象！特别是他的色彩，我太喜欢了！<br/>
I knew I had to hire that guy to work on the cover art for Forager.<br/>
我知道我得请他为浮岛物语制作封面设计了。<br/>
At the time I was running out of money and this was WAY before the patrecn donations.<br/>
那个时候，我的钱也花光了，距离众筹还有很长的一段时间。<br/>
Luckily Jon agreed to work with me at a VERY reasonable price, I promised myself I would hire him more if Forager ever became a financial success...<br/>
幸运的是Jon同意以非常合适的价格与我一起工作，我下定决心，如果浮岛物语取得成功将会更好的价格雇佣他。<br/>
We have been working together ever since!<br/>
从那时起我们就一直在一起工作！<br/>

![](/assets/images/forager/ConceptDesign/10.jpeg)
We were working on the game HARD. I barely noticed that it was getting popular.<br/>
我们非常努力地完善这个游戏。以至于我几乎都没有注意到浮岛物语正在变得越来越火。<br/>
More and more people were interested in my little dream game,<br/>
越来越多的人对我的游戏感兴趣<br/>
The project I had been working on for years.<br/>
我多年来一直致力于这个项目。<br/>
Eventually, I realized we needed a proper game logo, so I asked Gaz to draw a concept.<br/>
最终，我觉得我们需要一个合适的游戏标志，所以我请 Gaz 画一个概念图。<br/>
This is what he made. It was almost perfect! Some where along the way, we got rid of the Hammer, so we replaced that one with a Sword in the logo.The rest is history.<br/>
这就是他做的。 这几乎是完美的！ 一路上锤子并不是一直都在使用，所以我们使用剑取代了锤子。剩下的事情大家就都知道了。<br/>
