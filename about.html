<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is John Duff and I'm a Software Developer in Ottawa, Canada. I graduated from Software Engineering at Carleton University in 2006 and have been working full time ever since. I've been working with Ruby and Rails for most of my career and have dabbled in a multitude of other technologies.</p>
